## Personal Assessment

<p>I think one of my advantages is that I have an outstanding self-learning ablility, so that I can get familiar with one field soon. If some field drew my attention, I would look up for documents or tutorials as soon as possible.
<p>During my undergraduate, every time there is a lab, I am always the first person to finish them and offer my classmates who are in difficulty mints. And in a month, though simple, I read the doucuments of vue, gin, spring boot framwork and could build a full-stack application.
<p>As I went in a research group in our school, I went on a journey of Deep Learning for the first time. Through this experience, I learnt some basic knowlege in AI research, and inspire my interest in AI field.
<p>However, too much curiosity distracts me and makes me couldn't dive into some fields.
