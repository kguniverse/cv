## Personal Statement
<p>I have a strong passion in computer science, which is partly infulenced by my father, who has been working in Huawei for 15 years. I think computer technique is the most fancinating thing in 21st century. During the first three years in college, I rent more than ten linux servers to explore the inner fancy of the computer, rather than just use them. From nginx to fastapi, from language C to Golang, though my vigor and my packed tasks cannot support me to dive into these techniques, I always hold strong interest to accumate my experience.
<p>My algorithm ablity is equipped with solid foundation. Though my competition career was not successful, I solved more than 500 algorithm problems during my sophomore year. After I quit from training team, I still keep solving leetcode and codeforce problems for fun and focusing ICPC competition.
<p>I think one of my advantages is that I have an outstanding self-learning ablility, so that I can get familiar with one field soon. If some field drew my attention, I would look up for documents or tutorials as soon as possible. During summer vacation at the end of the sophomore year, despite ICPC training, I learnt introduction to Data Analysis and some basic deep learning knewledge. Soon after I applied for a intern in a laboratory researching application on graphic asthetic assessment of deep learning.
<p>During my undergraduate, every time there was a lab task, I was always one of the first few people to finish them and offer my classmates who are in difficulty mints. And in two weeks, though simply, I read the doucuments of gin framwork and could build an api application. In one week, I read the wechat development documents and used fastapi to build a course assistent robot having config script parser and interface to WeChat public account, which makes me stand out in this course.
<p>Microsoft is definitly my enlightenment teacher in computer, because when I was three years old I meet the first PC is equipped with windows 98. And I applied for windows10 previewer in 2015 when I was a middle school student. I still remember my storage knowlege in operating system is gained when I tried to install both windows8 and windows8.1 into the same disk on my dilapidated Toshiba laptop. 
<p>Now, here is a chance to join my enlightenment team, I would not waste this opportunity to join and learn more from here.
